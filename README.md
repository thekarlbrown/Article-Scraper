# Article-Scraper
Utilizing the BeautifulSoup and Requests Libraries I developed an algorithm to clean and format HTML into paragraphs. 
This is part of my bigger project, Divination, which performs Market Analysis using News Articles, Stock Data, Neural Networks, and Genetic Algorithms.
Most news sites can be scraped using this approach I designed myself.
You first identify the section with the primary text, then mention any areas inside it to the algorithm
Headings, tweets and paragraph spacing is also removed.
